# PrestigePlus mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous 

Add Shadowdancer prestige class, and Rogue Talent Defensive Roll. Apart from some minor tweaks, all the homebrew stuff are optional.

## Featuring

### New classes: 

[Shadowdancer](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/core-rulebook/shadowdancer/)   
Homebrew Options:  
- Summon Shadow: You can choose an animal companian instead and make it undead!
- Shadow Jump: You can choose any feat from the dimentional feat chain instead! This requires [Microscopic Content Expansion mod](https://github.com/alterasc/MicroscopicContentExpansion/), which requires [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core). If you don't want these feats, my mod doesn't require anything, as the original feature will still be there.

### New Rogue Talents

- [Defensive Roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/paizo-rogue-advanced-talents/defensive-roll-ex/)
I homebrew it to work like a one-time last stand, so at least it looks like an advanced talent :)
