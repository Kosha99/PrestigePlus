## Featuring

### [Agent of the Grave Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/a-b/agent-of-the-grave/)
- The class has only 5 levels.
- Agent of the Grave lose spell progression at level 1. I have no idea why my code can make you lose spell progression, but it just works.
- Hide your alignment!
#### Homebrew Options:  
- At level 5 you can learn all necromancy spells (require 13 int, full caster)
- Or become a ghoul! (you're undead so incompatible with lichdom)
- Or become a vampire! (require blood drinker, incompatible with lichdom)
### [Arcane Archer Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/core-rulebook/arcane-archer/)   
- A True Imbue Arrow is always with a quickened spell XD
- And we have [Deadeye Devotee](https://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Arcane%20Archer%20Deadeye%20Devotee)!
#### Homebrew Options:  
- Storm of Arrows: a mythic ability to increase the number of uses of Hail of Arrows!
### [Chevalier Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/c-d/chevalier/)
- The class has only 3 levels.
### [Horizon Walker Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/apg/horizon-walker/)
- The Terrain Mastery abilities of Astral Plane and Abyss are actually useless in the module but they are prerequisites for their Terrain Dominance.
- There isn't a GM available telling which creature is native to where, so ONLY ABYSS's favored enemy bonus works, for demons (which is written explicitly in the its description). And you guys probably won't focus on other creatures anyway lol
### [Hinterlander Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/e-h/hinterlander/)
- Master Archer gives access to [Deadeye’s Blessing in TTT](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base) and [Pinpoint Targeting in ExpandedContent](https://github.com/ka-dyn/ExpandedContent), but you'll need the respective mod active to select them. If you don't want these feats, my mod doesn't require anything, as the original feature will still be there.
- Gain a new Favored Terrain at level 2, 6, and an upgrade at level 9, 10. No need to study for 24 hours!
### [Inheritor’s Crusader Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/i-m/inheritor-s-crusader/)
- The class has only 3 levels.
#### Homebrew Options:  
- Spells per day/Destroyer of Tyranny/Sword Against Injustice: Now warpriest-friendly!
### [Sanguine Angel Class (Lite)](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/s-z/sanguine-angel/)
- Require [Dark Codex](https://github.com/Truinto/DarkCodex), or you won't gain Prodigious Two-Weapon Fighting。
- The class has 10 levels, but I only implement the first 3 levels because it doesn't have good stuff at higher levels.
#### Homebrew Options:  
- Become an Angel of Death early! (require precise shot)
### [Scar Seeker Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/s-z/scar-seeker/)   
- Gain spell progression at level 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
### [Shadowdancer Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/core-rulebook/shadowdancer/)   
#### Homebrew Options:  
- Summon Shadow: You can choose an animal companian instead and make it undead!
- Shadow Jump: You can choose any feat from the dimentional feat chain instead! This requires [Microscopic Content Expansion mod](https://github.com/alterasc/MicroscopicContentExpansion/), which requires [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core). If you don't want these feats, my mod doesn't require anything, as the original feature will still be there.
- Extra Shadow Jump: This is a homebrew feat that gives you 4 extra uses of Shadow Jump ability and you can take it as soon as shadowdancer level 1!
  
### New Rogue Talents

- [Defensive Roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/paizo-rogue-advanced-talents/defensive-roll-ex/)
- I homebrew it to work like a one-time last stand, so at least it looks like an advanced talent :)
