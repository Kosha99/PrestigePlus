## Featuring

### [Agent of the Grave Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/a-b/agent-of-the-grave/)
- The class has only 5 levels.
- Agent of the Grave lose spell progression at level 1. I have no idea why my code can make you lose spell progression, but it just works.
- Hide your alignment!
#### Homebrew Options:  
- At level 5 you can learn all necromancy spells (require 13 int, full caster)
- Or become a ghoul! (you're undead so incompatible with lichdom)
- Or become a vampire! (require blood drinker, incompatible with lichdom)
### [Arcane Archer Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/core-rulebook/arcane-archer/)   
- A True Imbue Arrow is always with a quickened spell XD
- And we have [Deadeye Devotee](https://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Arcane%20Archer%20Deadeye%20Devotee)!
#### Homebrew Options:  
- Storm of Arrows: a mythic ability to increase the number of uses of Hail of Arrows!
### [Chevalier Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/c-d/chevalier/)
- The class has only 3 levels.
### [Hinterlander Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/e-h/hinterlander/)
- Master Archer gives access to [Deadeye’s Blessing in TTT](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Base) and [Pinpoint Targeting in ExpandedContent](https://github.com/ka-dyn/ExpandedContent), but you'll need the respective mod active to select them. If you don't want these feats, my mod doesn't require anything, as the original feature will still be there.
- Gain a new Favored Terrain at level 2, 6, and an upgrade at level 9, 10. No need to study for 24 hours!
### [Inheritor’s Crusader Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/i-m/inheritor-s-crusader/)
- The class has only 3 levels.
#### Homebrew Options:  
- Spells per day/Destroyer of Tyranny/Sword Against Injustice: Now warpriest-friendly!
### [Shadowdancer Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/core-rulebook/shadowdancer/)   
#### Homebrew Options:  
- Summon Shadow: You can choose an animal companian instead and make it undead!
- Shadow Jump: You can choose any feat from the dimentional feat chain instead! This requires [Microscopic Content Expansion mod](https://github.com/alterasc/MicroscopicContentExpansion/), which requires [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core). If you don't want these feats, my mod doesn't require anything, as the original feature will still be there.
- Extra Shadow Jump: This is a homebrew feat that gives you 4 extra uses of Shadow Jump ability and you can take it as soon as shadowdancer level 1!
  
### New Rogue Talents

- [Defensive Roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/rogue-talents/paizo-rogue-advanced-talents/defensive-roll-ex/)
- I homebrew it to work like a one-time last stand, so at least it looks like an advanced talent :)
