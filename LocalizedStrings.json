Spellcasters use their abilities to safely cast spells from hiding and then move quickly away, while classes devoted to hand-to-hand combat enjoy the ability to attack foes with the element of surprise. Some even take the name of their kind quite literally, becoming eerie and mysterious performers and dancers, though more often the temptation presented by their talents with deception and infiltration causes shadowdancers to turn to lives of thievery.",

Warlords eschew armor as impractical to their harsh and often desert-like environment, preferring the free movement of near-nakedness. Warlords tend to specialize in the traditional weapons of Barsoom, leaving them ignorant of even simple Weapons common on other worlds. The same impulse that guides a warlord to stick to the traditional garb and gear of his culture can lead to a single-mindedness of purpose that can propel him far within his tribe or noble house. Even warlords of low status in Martian society claim a connection— no matter how ancient—with some great chieftain or emperor, seeing in the glorious past a path to a more hopeful future. Barsoom confers noble status upon its warlords through ritual combat in the case of green Martians or on merit and upon great achievement or heroics in the case of red Martians, so climbing the ladder ofstatus is an important part of a warlord’s journey through life.",
